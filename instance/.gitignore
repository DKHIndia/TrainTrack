# Specific to your app.py's default passcodes if you haven't moved them to environment variables
# If you are using actual environment variables, these lines are not strictly needed.
# But it's good practice to ensure no sensitive info accidentally gets committed.
# If you hardcoded passcodes in app.py for dev, ensure they are NOT the production ones.
# For production, always use environment variables.
# Remove or comment out these if your passcodes are truly external.
